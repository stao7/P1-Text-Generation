# P1 Text Generation

This project use a simple context-free grammar to generate three line of words about a mission.

When the "reroll it" is clicked, the text will be slightly different with some of the convertible words changing.

Artist statement:
I am trying to achieve the effect of the whenever the roll it is clicked, the text will show a different interesting story with the words changing. I believe I achieved this by putting the words in as many as I can in each type of the vocabularies.
